Tiny GUI is a 3D windowing and widget library that works exclusively with the Object-oriented Graphics Rendering Engine (OGRE).

Based on 'Bad Sectors GUI' (BSGUI).

Note: This project was started before the OGRE GUI explosion and is no longer being developed.  If you need a good GUI for OGRE check the links on the right.
